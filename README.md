#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment



#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   1.	Windows installation media. This could be an installation ISO or DVD.
2.	I installed windows 10 as that is what is compatible with my pc.

Challenges Encountered:
-	The PC is old, it took longer to install. The best thing to do would be to get a new machine. 




2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   This is the perfect IDE needed suitable for flutter and dart. I installed it and then ran it as an administrator.
After installing VS code I installed python, dart and flutter as extensions.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   I installed git bash. I created a github account, I set up the username and password.
   after installing gitbash, I connected my github account to my gitbash by following this command: git config --global user .name "my name"
   Ran the commond and then put in git config --global user .email.
   ran the command git config --global push.default simple
   added the SSH key to my github, theb tested the connection then it connected.s

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  1.	The first step was to look up python on the web, specifically for windows 10.
2.	After downloading the installer, the next step was to  double-click the.exe file to start the Python installer (python-3.10.11 used). 
3.	To make the Python launcher application accessible to  the computer, I Proceeded to select the option to Install the launcher for all users by checking the associated checkbox.
4.	By selecting the Add python.exe to PATH checkbox, I can execute Python directly from the command line.
5.	Then install.
6.	I then went to my cmd , then checked for the version by using phython â€“version.
7.	It was successfully stored on the machine.
Challenge encountered: 
Because my pc is a bit old, it took most of the day to install python. I also had to use py instead of python to get the version installed on my pc.

   Launch the MySQL Installer for Windows after downloading it from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/.

I custumized it by choosing the serves according to my needs and then I executed it.
